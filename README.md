CSVParser
=========

This is a parser for comma separated value (CSV) documents. It can be run in the background, on a specific queue, froma  url, etc. see the header file for a full description of what it can do.

It takes three steps to get it working:
1. [[alloc] init]
2. Assign the delegate/handle the delegate methods
3. Load with your CSV table source

Please let me know if you have any questions! I'll be updating it as I use it in my own projects.
